## Installation

The C code should build cleanly with both `gcc` and `clang` in C99 mode.

Hint: After running `make config` the build environment settings can be
tweaked by editing the `config.mk` file. The tools shortcuts declared
there should give an idea which utilities are required to build utlib.
